# Starklotto ü™ô


üß™ Welcome to Starklotto, Decentralized lottery system built on the Starknet blockchain. This project harnesses the power of smart contracts, NFTs and stablecoins to offer a fair, transparent and globally accessible lottery experience.

Starklotto allows users to participate in sweepstakes using stablecoins such as USDC/DAI. Each ticket is issued as an NFT, and prizes are distributed automatically through smart contracts. Results are generated in a completely unbiased manner using on-chain randomization tools.


## Key features.

- üéü Tickets as NFTs: Proof of participation and potential future value.
- üèÜ Automatic prizes: Distributed directly to winners' wallets.
- üîí Unbiased results: Generated with on-chain randomization.
- üåê Global access: Participation using stablecoins and compatible wallets.
- ‚ö° Intuitive interface: Easy interaction to explore lotteries, buy tickets and view results.
